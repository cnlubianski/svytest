# Introduction

The **svytest** package provides formal diagnostic tests for assessing the role
of survey weights in regression modeling. Two complementary approaches are
implemented:

- **Difference-in-Coefficients test** (`diff_in_coef_test()`):  
  A Hausman–Pfeffermann style test comparing weighted and unweighted regression
  coefficients.

- **Weight-Association tests** (`wa_test()`):  
  A family of tests (DuMouchel–Duncan, Pfeffermann–Sverchkov, Wu–Fuller) that
  examine whether the survey weights are systematically associated with the
  response after conditioning on covariates.

Together, these tools help researchers evaluate whether survey weights are
ignorable or whether they materially affect inference.
