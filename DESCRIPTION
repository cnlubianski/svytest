Description: Provides diagnostic tests for assessing informativeness of survey 
    weights in regression models. Implements weighted-adjusted tests, 
    difference-in-coefficients, estimating-equation approaches, and 
    permutation-based methods. Helps analysts decide whether to incorporate 
    survey weights in analytic inference, particularly linear regressions.
